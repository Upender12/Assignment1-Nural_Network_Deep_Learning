1.1) So, here we are giving a string ‘python’, so we need to delete at least two characters, here in the output given below, ‘t’ and ‘p’ has been deleted and therefore after deleting two characters in this case, the reserved string is nohy.
#
1.2) Here, for the first number we gave 5 and the second number we gave 10, so according to these values we perform addition as 15 and subtraction, multiplication and division.
#
